========
This is a proposal of a model to sustainably and fairly fund a great amount of free software projects. Hopefully we will soon have a reference implementation too. The idea is to use blockchain technology (cryptocurrency) to automatically and locally distribute the amount donated to all the free-software installed. The system would allow the end user to fund all the projects he/she makes use of with only one transaction, be it a visible application or an "invisible" one, like daemons. We can provide defaults, but ultimately only the end user can decide and control which projects to donate to. There will be no middle-man in control or taking a slice of everything. The projects to receive donations have to opt-in by providing a bitcoin (maybe some other cryptocurrency, to be decided) address with the software.

This model will decrease the difficulty of donating to multiple parties to a minimum, which hopefully will encourage donating. The potential income will encourage software developers to utilize the model. Increased income will allow more resources on each project, and competition for end-users will turn into even better software. The ultimate goal would be free software dominating the world without lock-in, while enjoying sustainable income.
