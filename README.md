========
This is a proposal of a model to sustainably and fairly fund a great amount of free software projects. Hopefully we will soon have a reference implementation too. The idea is to use blockchain technology (cryptocurrency) to automatically and locally distribute the amount donated to all the free-software installed. The system would allow the end user to fund all the projects he/she makes use of with only one transaction, be it a visible application or an "invisible" one, like daemons. We can provide defaults, but ultimately the end user only can decide and control which projects will receive the donation. There will be no middle-man in control or taking a slice of anything. The projects chosen will receive 100%. The projects to receive donations have to opt-in by providing a bitcoin (maybe some other cryptocurrency, to be decided) address together with the software.

This model will decrease the difficulty of donating to multiple parties to a minimum, which hopefully will encourage donating. The potential income will encourage software developers to utilize the model. Increased income will allow more resources on each project, and competition for end-users will turn into even better software. The ultimate goal would be free software dominating the world without lock-in, while enjoying sustainable income.

We will not be able to control any other aspect of the model than the default settings of our reference implementation. All aspects will be in control of the distributor of the software. Ultimately we will also be subject to the same challenges related to funding as all other free software projects, because we cannot steal any part of the donations, only our fair share like everyone else. If our model works, it will provide us sustainable funding to further improve the model. If not, we will die. If our implementation is poor, someone else can fork us and take our share of future donations.

Our first goal is to implement the model for a GNU/Linux distribution and make sure funding the "wallet" isn't too difficult. Then we will try to get a distro to try it out. Later on we will think about free software on other platforms and see if we can create a model that works well on them.

We will be raising funds for the project on Counterparty.
